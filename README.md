# Examples to test ESP32 with DTH sensor and Cayenne

This repository has two examples to exhibit the operation of DHT sensor and the
transmission of this data to the Cayenne Platform.

The examples are:

* ESP32-DHT21, which is based on a DHT example taken from the library.
* ESP32-Cayenne, which is based on the example of the Cayenne library.

This examples are intended to run in VSCode editor employing an extension for
Arduino. Settings here should be changed to match your own environment.
